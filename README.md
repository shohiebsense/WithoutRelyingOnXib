# No Rely On XIB Showcase

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of building a user interface entirely through code, without relying on Xcode Interface Builder (XIB) files or Storyboards. By adopting a purely programmatic approach, this showcase highlights the flexibility and control that developers have over their UI components.

## Features

- **Purely Programmatic UI**: All UI elements are created and configured in code, showcasing the power of programmatic layout constraints and UIKit components.
- **Custom Toolbar**: A custom toolbar is implemented to demonstrate how to create and manage UIBarButtonItems programmatically.
- **Back Button and Title**: The toolbar includes a back button and a centered title, both of which are dynamically created and styled in code.

## Why Programmatic UI?

- **Version Control**: Code-based UI is easier to manage in version control systems, as it avoids the binary files associated with XIBs and Storyboards.
- **Dynamic UI**: Programmatic UI allows for more dynamic and responsive interfaces, enabling easier integration with data and application state.
- **Reusability**: UI components can be easily reused and modified across different parts of the application without needing to duplicate XIB files.
- **Testing**: Programmatic UI can be more easily tested and mocked, leading to better unit and integration test coverage.
